        For the purposes hereof, I shall be deemed incapacitated in the event my Agent comes into possession of a duly executed and acknowledged written certificate of my licensed physician certifying that such physician has examined me and has concluded that by reason of accident, physical or mental illness or deterioration, or other similar cause, I have become incapacitated to act rationally and prudently in my personal care and financial matters.  Such incapacity shall be deemed to continue until such certificate has become inapplicable or has been revoked.  A physician's certificate may be revoked by a similar certificate to the effect that I am no longer incapacitated, executed either by the originally certifying physician or by two (2) other licensed, unrelated physicians.
