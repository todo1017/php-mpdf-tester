  <p>I, _____________, the principal, an adult of sound mind, execute this Healthcare Power of Attorney freely and voluntarily, with an understanding of its purposes and consequences.  I intend to create a medical durable power of attorney under the laws of the State of Arkansas.  I further intend to demonstrate my wishes concerning medical treatment with clear and convincing evidence.  I hereby revoke any Healthcare Power of Attorney previously granted by me as principal except powers granted by me under any state statutory Healthcare Power of Attorney.</p>
  <p>This Healthcare power of Attorney is intended to comply with the Arkansas Rights of Terminally Ill or Permanently Unconscious Act and the Arkansas Healthcare Decisions Act (collectively, the “Acts”) and to the extent that any provision of this Living Will conflicts with a provision of the Acts, the provisions of the Acts will be deemed to control.</p>

      <p class="section11">Section 2.01</p>
      <p class="section12">Instructions Concerning Medical Evaluations and Treatment</p>
    </div>
    <p>In exercising the authority granted to my Agent, I instruct my Agent to discuss with me the specifics of any proposed decision regarding my medical care and treatment if I am able to communicate in any manner however rudimentary, even by blinking my eyes.  I further instruct my Agent that if I am unable to give an informed consent to medical treatment, my Agent shall give or withhold consent based upon any treatment choices I have expressed while competent, whether under this instrument or otherwise.  If my Agent cannot determine the treatment choice I would want made under the circumstances, then I request that my Agent make the choice for me based upon what my Agent believes to be in my best interests.  I request that my Agent’s decision be guided by taking into account:</p>
    <p class="indent1_strict">the provisions of this instrument;</p>
    <p class="indent1_strict">any preferences that I may have expressed on the subject;</p>
    <p class="indent1_strict">what my Agent believes I would want done in the circumstances if I were able to express myself; and</p>
    <p class="indent1_strict">any information given to my Agent by the physicians treating me as to my medical diagnosis and prognosis and the intrusiveness, pain, risks, and side effects of the treatment.</p>
    <p>I want to leave my family, friends, and persons who care about me with assurances of my love, and without the burdens of guilt or conflict.  My purposes in leaving these instructions are to alleviate uncertainty that otherwise may arise in connection with decisions about my medical care, to promote family harmony, and to clarify instructions to my health care providers.  My Agent’s authority to act on my behalf concerning my medical care includes decisions concerning artificial life support, medical treatment, surgery and other medical procedures; artificial nourishment and hydration; resuscitation decisions (including Do Not Resuscitate [DNR] orders and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation [CPR] directives); amputation of my limbs; blood transfusions; experimental drugs and medical procedures; the administration of pharmaceutical agents; arrangements for my longterm care.</p>
    <p>I affirm my belief in the importance and value of my personal dignity, both in living and in dying.</p>

    </div>
    <p>My Agent may select a facility for my nursing, convalescent, or hospice care and establish my residence and placement in a secure unit therein if the facility provides the quality of care appropriate for my medical needs and mental condition.  For the purposes of arranging or providing longterm care, my Agent has authority to facilitate my transportation and establish my legal residence within or beyond the state of Arkansas.</p>

    <p>
      I authorize my Agent to take whatever steps are necessary or advisable to enable me to remain in my personal residence as long as it is reasonable under the circumstances.  I realize that my health may deteriorate so that it becomes necessary to have round-the-clock nursing care if I am to remain in my personal residence, and I direct my Agent to obtain that care, including any equipment that might assist in my care, as is reasonable under the circumstances.  Specifically, I do not want to be hospitalized or put in a convalescent or similar home as long as it is reasonable to maintain me in my personal residence.

    <p>I want to ensure that my Agent and physician protect my comfort and freedom from pain insofar as possible.  I authorize my Agent to consent on my behalf to the administration of whatever pain-relieving drugs and pain-relieving surgical procedures my Agent, upon medical advice, believes may provide comfort to me, even though such drugs or procedures may lead to pharmaceutical addictions, lower blood pressure, lower levels of breathing, or hasten my death.  Even if artificial life support or aggressive medical treatment has been withdrawn or refused, I want to be kept as comfortable as possible, and I do not want to be neglected by medical or nursing staff.</p>
